    Option one: Tennis scoring
  </h1>
  <p>
    Write a program that simulates a simple tennis game. * Scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “fifteen”, “thirty”, and “forty” respectively. * If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is “advantage” for the player in the lead. * If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is “deuce”. * A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent
